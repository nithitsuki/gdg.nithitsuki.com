## Problem Statements

### 1. Web Development

**Task:** Build a mini blogging platform with the following features:

- User registration/login system (basic authentication)
- Users can create, edit, and delete blog posts
- Each post must include a title, content, and timestamp
- Store data in a database (MySQL, MongoDB, Firebase, or any equivalent)

**Expected Deliverables:**

- Live deployed link (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or any hosting)
- GitHub repository with code and README (including setup guide)
- At least minimal frontend styling (not plain HTML text)

### 2. DevOps & Cybersecurity

#### Option A – DevOps: Automate Your Meme Factory

1. Pick any meme generator API (or even a static funny image)
2. Write a simple script/app (Python/Node.js) that overlays funny captions on the meme
3. Set up a GitHub Actions (or GitLab CI) pipeline that:
	- Runs automatically whenever a new caption idea (text/JSON file) is committed
	- Builds the meme with the new caption
	- Deploys it automatically to GitHub Pages / Netlify / a simple web server
	- **(Bonus):** Posts the meme link to Slack/Discord

**Expected Deliverables (DevOps):**

- Source code
- Dockerfile
- Deployment configs (GitHub Actions / GitLab CI)
- Proof of deployment (public link or short demo video)

#### Option B – Cybersecurity: Capture the Flag (CTF)

1. Go to [picoCTF Practice](https://play.picoctf.org/practice)
2. Choose any 5 medium-level questions from any domain
3. Solve them and document your process
4. If the challenge involves vulnerable code, provide a fixed version of the snippet

**Expected Deliverables (Cybersecurity):**

- List of solved challenges with brief explanation of approach
- Screenshots of successful flags
- Fixed code snippet(s) if applicable
