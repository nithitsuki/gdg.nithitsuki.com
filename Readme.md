## Problem Statements

### 1. Web Development

**Task:** Build a mini blogging platform with the following features:

- User registration/login system (basic authentication)
- Users can create, edit, and delete blog posts
- Each post must include a title, content, and timestamp
- Store data in a database (MySQL, MongoDB, Firebase, or any equivalent)

**Expected Deliverables:**

- Live deployed link (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or any hosting)\
  **NOW LIVE AT [https://blog.gdg.nithitsuki.com/](https://blog.gdg.nithitsuki.com/)!!!**
- GitHub repository with code and README (including setup guide)\
  Well, you're already here, so good job!\
  (setup guide is in [gdg-mini-blog/README.md](gdg-mini-blog/README.md))
- At least minimal frontend styling (not plain HTML text)\

### 2. DevOps & Cybersecurity

#### Option A â€“ DevOps: Automate Your Meme Factory

1. Pick any meme generator API (or even a static funny image)
2. Write a simple script/app (Python/Node.js) that overlays funny captions on the meme
3. Set up a GitHub Actions (or GitLab CI) pipeline that:
	- Runs automatically whenever a new caption idea (text/JSON file) is committed
	- Builds the meme with the new caption
	- Deploys it automatically to GitHub Pages / Netlify / a simple web server
	- **(Bonus):** Posts the meme link to Slack/Discord

**Expected Deliverables (DevOps):**

- Source code
- Dockerfile
- Deployment configs (GitHub Actions / GitLab CI)\
  Right [this way](.github/workflows/meme-pipeline.yml)!
- Proof of deployment (public link or short demo video)\

#### Option B â€“ Cybersecurity: Capture the Flag (CTF)

1. Go to [picoCTF Practice](https://play.picoctf.org/practice)
2. Choose any 5 medium-level questions from any domain
3. Solve them and document your process
4. If the challenge involves vulnerable code, provide a fixed version of the snippet

In light of **Taking up insane amount of work when I know I shouldn't**. I have unfortunately not had the time to compile 5 write-ups for the quetions I've solved (Yup, I've solved medium qns before!).

Knowing that this situation is kindaa relatable for some of you guys as well (*\*cough\** madhumitha *\*cough\** ), I hope that you all can spare me a bit in this regard.
